Main character is Zalyth. Zalyth is a conceded asshat who thinks he's the baddest dude around. One day while running from level 2 enemy's in a forest, he finds a ultimate sword of power.
He then spends 3 months and 2 days 18 hours 43 minutes and 29 seconds raising his fame and fortune throughout the land until one day while finishing his final quest his ultimate sword of power is 
stolen from him by a bird. Left with only his shield, Zalyth has to find a way to reclaim his source of power...only this time he'll have to earn it.

Xenia is a black mage who is a fan of the the legend of Zalyth. When she hears about him being nearby she goes there asap. Normally Zalyth would adcept her with open arms but in his current form he's powerless so
he tries him best to advoid her. However, Xenia won't stop so easily...
She is a reaquring character who helps out shield hero at many points in the game. She has a somewhat upity character but a somewhat elegantness to her. She uses the poweer of magic to her disposal.
Once she see's Zalyth in action her opinon changes somewhat negatively but as they travel togethor she'll see him grow into a hero.
