Story begins in the forest scene where the MC is fighting a horde of enemies and is preveiling in his trials.
*cuts panel*
MC has defeated enemies and is telling the story of his journey but then is interupted by a random crow that swoops in and steals his 
ultimate sword of power. MC is like "You bastaredo! Come back here pls" and chaces after the bird. Forest level ensues and Zalyth makes his way through the world and reaches the boss. Upon defeating him Zalyth loses track of the bird and
becomes distressed. He then comes upon a town where he searches for answers regarding the whereabouts of the bird. Zalyth then gets a lead leading him to nearby ruins. On his way out, Ferana(Dark Elf) finds Zalyth and ask to join in his adventure.
Zalyth is hesitant to adcept and states he'll think about it. Running off he then goes through world 2 the ruins, Zalyth spots the bird. After Zalyth reaches the end of the level he spots the bird. The bird then mutates into a mosterus beast wielding the sword of ultimate power and 
beats down the hero coldly.(No way to win this) The bird then states that he seeks a world different than the world as it is. The only way to reach his goal is with the power only the ultimate sword can offer.
Zalyth then pases out. He wakes up in a cabin on the mountains. Looking around, Zalyth find a old mystical man who had saved him. In order to get stronger, Shield hero has to train with the man. This leads to the mountain world that has the player go through trials where at the end Zalyth has to fight the self he sees as weak. The "clone" will use all the same tactics as Zalyth. After defeating hime Zalyth recieves the hieghtned senseus.
(Sanji you do the specific gameplay changes) After this Zalyth sets out towards the desert of (idk) where he meets up with Ferana again. She decides to join him after he can prove his abilties. A fight ensues and Zalyth reins triumphant. Ferana then begins travelling with Zalyth.
Ferana and Zalyth decided to travel towards the Shoreline to see if they can find any clue about the whereabouts of his sword of Ultimate Power.
They then encounter Sirus and watch as he runs away with 2 minions bearing an Ark-type package. FYI: (SOMEHOW THERE WILL BE MECHANICAL MONSTERS AND MECHS AND GUNS CUZ ITS ME ERIC MAKING THE PLOT).
Ferana calims she can feel dark powers at work and suggests Zalyth follow them. Zalyth decide to pursue the people, thinking they may know the whereabouts of the sword.
*Pretty simple level, you encounter a sand-oriented enemy set. The kick is that you run slower on some parts of the map, such as when climbing up. This is a emphasized but short part of the game.*
