			<p>
				This is a proof-of-concept group for a paper I (Xeon) am writing, to be released publicly. The paper describes the similarities between the real economy and stock market with the Steam Market. Specifically, the paper outlines the implementation of different aspects of the real economy into the game economy, current and future planned. This group is a proof-of-concept of a <strong>mutual fund</strong>.
			</p>
	
			<h3><a id="method" class="anchor" href="#method" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h3>
			<p>
				The principle behind this mutual fund is simple. Say we wanted to buy something worth 9 refined for the purposes of making profit. A person pools in 1/3 of that amount, some other player pools in 1/3, and you pool in 1/3. The controller of that particular transaction buys the item and sells it for 12 refined, basically making 3 refined profit. Since each player pooled in about 1/3, the 3 ref is split exactly evenly, 1 refined to each person.	
			</p>
			<p>
				Now say we completed the transaction, but the <strong>dividend</strong> given to each person (for this proof-of-concept, the dividend is the amount of profit they receive for each transaction instead of a monthly payment) don't split evenly or are not substantial enough to equate to any item in the game. In this case, the amount is carried over to the next transaction, and all future transactions until it equates to an amount payable, or the person chooses not to even bother with it. Examples of cases like this include the dividend equating to a fraction of a weapon, something like 0.001 ref up to a weapon, or 0.05 ref.
